# LowLightImageEnhancement
This project develops specialized software to enhance low light images from Chandrayaan-2â€™s OHRC, focusing on Polar Shadowed Regions (PSR) of lunar craters. The goal is to improve Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for better interpretation in landing site selection and geomorphological analysis.
